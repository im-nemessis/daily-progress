“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it.”
                                       —Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger,


flaw in computer programs are usually called bugs.

if a program is crystallizes thought then bugs can be roughly catogerized into those cased by the thought being confused and those by mistake introduced while converting the thought into code.


the process of finding bugs is called -- “Debugging
 
 STRICT MODE

 Javascript can be made little stricter by enabling strict mode.
 this is done by putting string "use strict" at top of the file or function body.

 normally if we forget to put let in front of our bindings as with counter in a loop, Javascript quietly creates a global binding and uses that.

 in strict mode this is reported.

--ANOTHER CHANGE--

In strict mode "this" bindign holds the value undefined in a function that are not called as methods. 


strict mode disallows giving a function multiple parameters with same naem and removes certain problematic language feature as "with"

TYPES

we can add a comment like the following before the any binding and parameters 
one thing about the TYPES is that they need to introduce their know complexity to be able to describe enough code to be useful

||

([t]) -> t function from an array of Ts to a t.
