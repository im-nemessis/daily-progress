ABSTRACTION

ablity to hide  underlining details and ability to talk about the problem at a higher (or more abstract) level.

It is a useful skill, in programming, to notice when you are working at too
low a level of abstraction.

functions that operate on other function , either by taking them as or by retruning them are called higher-order function. 

HIigher-order function allow us to abstract over action not just values.

higher order function start to shine when we need to compose something.
